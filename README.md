### Ground rules before starting the task

-> No AI has been used at all at any point for this task. (had to use ChatGPT to figure out the errors regarding deploying on render, otherwise the code is self-written.)
-> Any aid needed to solve errors or get information about other functionalities has been done through the internet.
-> the github repo will be committed to regularly with each layer of task so as to keep a true metric of how the app is being developed.

each module has its separate documentation

major hurdles: deploying and express + react application ( more complex than a simple nextjs/sveltekit app that i have experience with)
rest it was a crud application with jwt, nothing i hadn't done before.
